LED Matrix Flappy Bird homage
===================

An interesting excercise in Arduino game programming using one button and an 8x8 LED matrix.

To run this project you need the following:

  1. Arduino board
  1. LED matrix and MAX7219 driver chip (cheap on eBay)
  1. LedControl Library (http://playground.arduino.cc/Main/LedControl)
  1. Timer Library (http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/Timer)

And here's how it looks.

Some cool people have extended this project even further, with bi-color LEDs and everything! Check it out at http://jollifactory.blogspot.no/2015/06/arduino-based-bi-color-led-matrix_13.html
